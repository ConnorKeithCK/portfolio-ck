# Hello there!

My name is Connor Keith and I am a full stack developer! Most of my industry experience lies within React, Node, and MongoDB, however I've opted to learn NextJS for this portfolio site. The site itself is built to mimic a modern day desktop environment, where the "dock" at the bottom serves as the navgiation bar you would typically see on a website! Use that to move around and explore the site :)

# Education

I am graduating (or have graduated depdending on when you're reading this :P) from the University of Cincinnati in Spring of 2022. I will be receiving my Bachelor of Science in Information Technology - Software Development track alongside my Master of Science in Information Technology, thanks to the accelerated program at UC. I've completed 4 total semester long co-op rotations at various companies (see my resume on the site), alongside part-time & full-time work throughout school semesters at my current employer, Refract Labs. In total, I've had about 2 years of full stack experience prior to graduation!

# Projects

Unfortunately, most of my work hides behind company firewalls and is therefore inaccessible. Some of my public work includes:


## Joot
Joot is a online tool & site to ease CCO compliance. The site below is not the actual application, simply Joot's website to get some more information and see some previews of the site :)

# Skills

Although pretty much all of my industry experience has revolved around full stack web development, I have dabbled in quite a few other languages & domains! Here is a list of my other experiences :)


<ol>
  <li>Java</li>
  <li>PHP</li>
  <li>Google Cloud Platform</li>
  <li>SpringBoot</li>
  <li>React-Native/Expo</li>
  <li>C#</li>
  <li>Linux (my daily driver as of recent!)</li>
  <li>Version Control (Git, GitHub, BitBucket)</li>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>SQL</li>
  <li>TypeScript</li> 
  <li>Machine Learning</li>
  <li>Serverless functions</li>
  <li>System Diagrams</li>
 </ol>

I consider myself a lifelong learner and really do enjoy picking up new languages & skills. I'm interested in all kinds of software development and technology in general, not just web development! I pick up new skills at a very quick pace and love a good challenge!
