# Hello there!

My name is Connor Keith and I am a full stack developer! Most of my industry experience lies within React, Node, and MongoDB, however I've opted to learn NextJS for this portfolio site. The site itself is built to mimic a modern day desktop environment, where the "dock" at the bottom serves as the navgiation bar you would typically see on a website! Use that to move around and explore the site :)

# Education

I am graduating (or have graduated depdending on when you're reading this :P) from the University of Cincinnati in Spring of 2022. I will be receiving my Bachelor of Science in Information Technology - Software Development track alongside my Master of Science in Information Technology, thanks to the accelerated program at UC. I've completed 4 total semester long co-op rotations at various companies (see my resume on the site), alongside part-time & full-time work throughout school semesters at my current employer, Refract Labs. In total, I've had about 2 years of full stack experience prior to graduation!

I began programming at an early age, sometime in middle school, thanks to ROBLOX! Friends and I would use Lua to create our own games, although nothing really ever came out of it :). Moving forward, I dablled in some Python and Java, primarily focusing on Minecraft plugins. While school has certainly benefited my programming education & career, most of my programming education has come from my own initiative and willingness to learn.

# Projects

Unfortunately, most of my work hides behind company firewalls and is therefore inaccessible. Some of my public work(not open source, but projects have been released) includes:


## Joot
Joot is a online tool & site to ease CCO compliance. The site below is not the actual application, simply Joot's website to get some more information and see some previews of the site :)

## KreditKing
KreditKing is my senior capstone project for UC! Myself and 3 other students teamed up to tackle the issue of credit cards being malicously targeted towards college students. The project was conceptualized, planned, and created within the two-semester limit for the course. Our primary stack was ReactNative and utilized NodeJS to connect to our Cloud Firestore database and integrate with the Plaid API.

KreditKing allows students, or anyone really, to add any credit card to their account using Plaid. From there, they are presented with information regarding their spending across all credit cards in one convienent location. Planned features include setting budgets across multiple cards, recommending which card to use when purchasing specific items for maximized rewards, and more!


 At the time of this being written, it is still under development so check back soon for a project URL!


# Skills

Although pretty much all of my industry experience has revolved around full stack web development, I have dabbled in quite a few other languages & domains! Here is a list of my other experiences :)


<ol>
  <li>Java</li>
  <li>PHP</li>
  <li>Google Cloud Platform</li>
  <li>SpringBoot</li>
  <li>React-Native/Expo</li>
  <li>C#</li>
  <li>Linux (my daily driver as of recent!)</li>
  <li>Version Control (Git, GitHub, BitBucket)</li>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>SQL</li>
  <li>TypeScript</li> 
  <li>Machine Learning</li>

 </ol>

I consider myself a lifelong learner and really do enjoy picking up new languages & skills. I'm interested in all kinds of software development and technology in general, not just web development! I pick up new skills at a very quick pace and love a good challenge!
